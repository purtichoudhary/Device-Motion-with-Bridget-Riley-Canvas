# Device-Motion-with-Bridget-Riley-Canvas

This project replicates one of the Bridget Riley canvas using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

It shows a button "Click here to allow device motion" at the top the canvas.
Once you click on this button, it shows an alert that Device Motion is enabled on your device. 
Once the Device Motion is enabled, as you move your device the canvas also moves along with it.

To run the project, run the myCanvas.html file
